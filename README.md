tips to working with git and github

Name: Taran Panduranga

In the rare occasion that I am at a party, I tell people that I work with making unreadable data into something useful.

The three main activities I have been doing when studying is descrete math, statistics, and Calculus.

I have three effective ways for me to study. First I always try to learn from different sources to gain serveral perspecitves of one topic. Secondly, I make sure that the topic I am studying is fully understood instead of skimming over the subject. Lastly, when I study, I have a set time when I am studying, with short breaks in the middle. This helps with focus and procrastination.

Edit by Tanishq Jain:
I agree with your startegies that helps to concentrate.
